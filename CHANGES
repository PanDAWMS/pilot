60b:

Taking a 5s nap before copying and opening the jobReport.json file to make sure it is finished, in getTrfExitInfo(). Problem seen with some jobs, e.g. 2397783893
where the jobReport.json file was cut off, indicating that it was not finished writing to (RunJob)

Update info from Edward Karavakis:
- Added a retry mechanism with a sleep and if glexec fails, don't break the pilot
- Update panda server when glexec infrastructure fails
- Added a new pilot error code for glexec related failures: 1226
- List dirs and copy them instead of having them hardcoded (that's why glexec broke with HPC, radical)
- Corrected glexec_utils 2>&1 instead of 2>1
- Do not copy pilot proxy to /tmp when pinging glexec infrastructure, use X509_USER_PROXY instead

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

60c:

Update info from Edward Karavakis:

Update info from Wen Guan:
- Bug fix in getCopyPrefixPath() for a problem with wrong paths in overflow jobs, problems seen at BNL (SiteInformation)

TODO:

Prior to file registration (i.e. for US sites that still uses the pilot for file registrations), the pilot sets the LFC_HOST env variable; no longer needed for file 
registrations using DQ2 functions test with a job run in the US, BNL e.g. which still uses the pilot for file registrations

todo: remove the explicit usages of schedconfig.lfchost and replace with an experiment specific method (getFileCatalog())
todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
