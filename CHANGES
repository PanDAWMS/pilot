////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


TODO:

Remove singletons:
- Change __experiment to experiment in Experiment classes
- Use super() in __init__() (ATLASExperiment)
- Same changes to SiteInformation classes

62.1?
Avoiding setting exit code 1008/65 when no jobs were downloaded in getJob(), requested by John Hover (pilot)

REMOVE OTHERSITEMOVER FROM DIST
HUSITEMOVER?

Prior to file registration (i.e. for US sites that still uses the pilot for file registrations), the pilot sets the LFC_HOST env variable; no longer needed for file 
registrations using DQ2 functions test with a job run in the US, BNL e.g. which still uses the pilot for file registrations

todo: remove the explicit usages of schedconfig.lfchost and replace with an experiment specific method (getFileCatalog())
todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
