Complete change log for the Pilot 1
-----------------------------------


72.0

General changes:
- Added TURL to file state dictionary in stagein_real(), needed for direct access in prod jobs (mover)
- Now using proper job.isAnalysisJob() in __main__() (RunJob)
- Corrected exception handling in getContainerName() (Singularity)
- Removed sitename from detect_client_location, and from all it's calls (via stagein()), replaced with readpar (mover)
- Added movers to redundancy list in removeRedundantFiles() (ATLASExperiment)
- Now using isRootFileName() in is_directaccess() to determine whether the file is a root file or not (Job)

Now using associated storages when looking up replicas by getting all associated endpoints from astorages
- Using resolvePandaAssociatedStorages() instead of _prepare_input_ddm() in resolve_replicas() (mover)
- As discussed in thread "Multiple read DATADISK per PQ"

Resource type
- Added new pilot option -R <resourceType>, forwarded to dispatcher with getJob. Requested by Tadashi Maeno (pilot, Job)

1. clean 'es_read' activity in pilot: 'es_read' was added to read remotely for cases to run ES when there is a local
storage downtime. It's not used.
2. to support failover for es: attach two storages in agis for ES, if the first one fails, it will failover to the
second storage. For the first storage, it will use 'es_events' activity if defined, otherwise it will use 'pw'
activity. So for opportunistic PQs, we need to define 'es_events', but for normal PQs, we can run ES without defining
'es_events'.
3. update the default zip_time_gap. If pledgedcpu is -1, default zip_time_gap is 600 s (10 minutes). Otherwise it's 2 hours.
4. based on es_failover, ES can support storages blacklisting: either es_events or es_failover can be blacklisted.

Commit Summary

Updates from Alexey Anisenkov

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/179

Base Sitemovers workflow updates:

implemented proper direct_access handling both for ANALY and PROD jobs over LAN and WAN in sitemovers
set by default direct access mode enabled for Analy jobs but disabled for Prod jobs (in Job class)
isolated remoteinput allowed schemes into JobMover.remoteinput_allowed_schemas; for the moment 'root' is only considered as allowed schema.. but can be easily extended with davs, gsiftp, etc..
Note: currently, the getNewJob() function in pilot.py modifies direct_access_lan and direct_access_wan queuedata settings based on Job parameters (e.g. transferType, is Analy) which is duplicating and confusing and actually should not be handled there but moved instead to Job constructor Job.setJobDef (it should be enough just disable 2lines of queuedata modification below)

As a side effect resetting direct_access_lan/wan settings by getNewJob will ignore default direct access settings set in Job.setJobDef.

https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/blob/main-dev/pilot.py#L2340

ec = env['si'].replaceQueuedataField("direct_access_lan", "False")
ec = env['si'].replaceQueuedataField("direct_access_wan", "False")

File Changes

M Job.py (18)
M movers/base.py (2)
M movers/mover.py (228)

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/182

Updates:

implemented base functionality to parse and overwrite data passed via jobPars settings
introduced --overwriteAGISdata arg option to overwrite queuedata coming from AGIS
added copytools and acopytools entries to overwriteAGISdata, update affected stagein/out functions
The format of overwriteAGISdata command line option in JobParameters is a string representation of python structures (need to be overwritten)

e.g.

jobPars = '
--overwriteAGISdata "{\'allowfax\':False,\'copytools\':{\'rucio\':{\'setup\':\'fakesetup.sh\'}, \'acopytools\':{\'pr\':[\'rucio\']}}"
'
to simply overwrite queuedata both for stage-in and stage-out (e.g. by HC jobs) and force use of Rucio sitemover following settings can be passed:

--overwriteAGISdata "{'copytools':{'rucio':{'setup':''}, 'acopytools':{}}"

Commit Summary

- implement base functionality to overwrite AGIS queuedata passed via jobPars settings
cosmetic fix: exclude None values from being parsed by overwrite AGIS queue data

72.2:

General changes:
(
Temporarily reverted due to a comment made by A. Filipcic - the -I option can cause problems on some systems. Need to be investigated further.

- Changed hostname -i to hostname -I in collectMachineFeatures() and getBenchmarkCommand(). Requested by Alastair Dewhurst:
"[hostname -i] will only list the IPv4 address on a dual stack machine.  Which can cause confusion if debugging problems.
If you change the command to "hostname -I" (a capital "i"), then it will print out all addresses the host has (eg both the IPv4 and IPv6 address)"
 (ATLASSiteInformation, Node)
)
- Updated error message for stage-in exceptions (grammar) (mover)

Checksum problem:
- Now using calc_file_checksum() from movers/base module instead of old adler32() which can give a partial result in case
  zlib.adler32() throws an exception. Reported by R. Walker. (SiteMover)

Write PandaIDs to file
- Added mode argument to writeFile() (FileHandling)
- Now writing PandaID to file used by the wrapper in getNewJob(). Requested by P. Love (pilot)

Updates from Wen Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/189

- Introduced overrideLogical argument in createPoolFileCatalog(), used by get_new_data() (pUtil, Mover)
- MUST BE TESTED WITH NORMAL HC CLOUDS JOBS AS WELL AS EVENT SERVICE JOBS WITH / WITHOUT DIRECT ACCESS

Error handing for trf exit code 146, requested by R. Walker:
- Added new error code ERR_NOUSERTARBALL=1246: "User tarball cannot be downloaded from PanDA server" (PilotErrors)
- Created extractTarballURL(). The slightly more descriptive error diagnostics will contain the tarball source URL if known (ErrorDiagnostics)
- Identifying exit code 146 in interpretPayload() using extractTarballURL() (ErrorDiagnostics)

72.7 - HOTFIX

Comment from Cedric Serfon:

Lancaster reported that Rucio was trying to access some files that were
never wrote in their storage element :
https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&ticket_id=133991 . After
investigation the problem is related to a bug in the rucio mover
stage-out : the upload fails but it is interpreted as a success.

Updates from Alexander Bogdanchikov

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/197

a) gfal_sitemover: support of dynafed+cloud ddmendpont was added.
The definition of such ddmendpoints (is_mkdir=True and se_flavour == "WEBDAV") may be the matter of change.

b) more accurate time HH:MM calculation for command "grid-proxy-info -exists -valid HH:MM"
previous version failed on short time limits.
