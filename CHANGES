TODO:

Prior to file registration (i.e. for US sites that still uses the pilot for file registrations), the pilot sets the LFC_HOST env variable; no longer needed for file 
registrations using DQ2 functions test with a job run in the US, BNL e.g. which still uses the pilot for file registrations

todo: remove the explicit usages of schedconfig.lfchost and replace with an experiment specific method (getFileCatalog())
todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
